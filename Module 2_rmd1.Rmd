when we complie our work we use `rmarkdown` package.

here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
       + eggs
       + toast
  
    - drink

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r pressure2, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## unsert tables
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
            caption= "Top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```


## insert an euation

$$ Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1x  $$
