## R Markdown

### this is a level three heading 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://goolge.com)

here is a word in **bold** and another word in a __bold__

here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

when we complie our work we use `rmarkdown` package.

here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
       + eggs
       + toast
  
    - drink
       + apple juice
       
here is an exapmle of a numbered list

1. breakfast

    a. apple
    
    b. coffee
    
2. lunch

    a. dosa
    
here is an example of blockquote:

> this is a blockquote. this
> paragraph has two lines
>
> 1. this is a list of insidea block quote.
> 2. this is second item

here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> this is a blockquote. this
> paragraph has two lines
>
> > this text is nested

here is an expamle of code in a blockquote:

>      2+2
>      mean(c(1,2,3,4,))


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r pressure2, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## unsert tables
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
            caption= "Top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```
